  content: "FretTime is a productivity app that helps string players structure their practice sessions with task cards and built-in timers. Instead of scattered practice notes, you get a system designed around how musicians actually work â€“ so, you can chunk your techniques and tunes into focused daily tasks while tracking your progress. <br /><br />Right now, I'm in Phase 2, and I'm adding a global count-down timer, an analytics dashboard, drag & drop functionality, and some other good stuff."
