# The FretTime Phase 2 Kickoff

_July 20, 2025_

## Milestones & Momentum

Yesterday was a moment I'll remember for a long time. After 14 days of focused development, **FretTime Phase 1** went live at [frettime.com](https://www.frettime.com). ðŸŽ‰

The UI looks pretty good. All the parts work. Real musicians will use it. Maybe? I hope. (I admit I didn't put a bunch of eggs in the idea-validation basket).

Part of this comeback story involves level-up coding, so that's a big part of what I'm doing right now. Just reviewing basics, learning some new stuff, and putting in my reps. Adding a little more complexity every day.

But, baby steps or not, finishing Phase 1 felt like a major victory. Now, there's momentum.

Of course, momentum is often a use it or lose it game. And, of course, I want to use it! Phase 2 kicks off today, and I don't want to slow down. The foundation of the app is pretty solid, the vision is clear, and the next two weeks can transform **FretTime** from an impressive first attempt to "holy crap, this is actually professional-grade software."

That's the goal, anyway. Let's see if I can pull it off!

## What We've Accomplished

**FretTime Phase 1 delivered exactly what it set out to do:**

âœ… **Core Architecture** â€“ Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Zustand state management  
âœ… **Practice Organization** â€“ Separate practice areas and projects with color-coded task cards  
âœ… **Task and Todo Management** â€“ Create, complete, and organize Todos within Task Cards  
âœ… **Timer System** â€“ Built-in timers for each task with start/stop functionality  
âœ… **Responsive Design** â€“ Mobile-first approach that works everywhere  
âœ… **Modern UX** â€“ Dark/light mode, smooth animations, context menus  
âœ… **Data Persistence** â€“ localStorage keeps your practice plans safe  
âœ… **Production Deployment** â€“ Live on Vercel with a custom domain

**The technical execution was super smooth.** No major bugs, with a clean codebase and proper TypeScript throughout. But more importantly, **the user experience feels right.** At least it feels right to me.

Hopefully, as interest builds around it other folks will test it and add their ten cents to this dialogue. (That reminds me, I need to set up comments on this blog).

Maybe some musicians will even try fitting **FretTime** into their practice workflow. We'll see!

## Where We're Heading

Phase 2 runs from July 20 to August 3 â€“ another focused 14-day sprint. The goal isn't just to add features; it's to see if **FretTime** can take on the air of a professional productivity tool while staying true to a musician's mindset.

I want to build something that helps practice time become more visible and intentional so that users can feel more organized and see genuine progress over time.

**So, this phase is about intelligence and insight**. Yep, time to do some dashboarding that can help users understand not just what they've practiced, but how effectively they're spending their time.

## Phase 2 Focus: The Essential Features

### **Global Focus Timer**

A dedicated countdown timer for time-boxing practice sessions. Set focused blocks of any interval and stay in a flow state without constantly checking individual task timers. Perfect for musicians who want to practice with intensity and boundaries.

### **Analytics Dashboard**

This is the big one. A comprehensive view of how practice time is actually being spent, with multiple perspectives:

- **Time segmentation** â€“ Daily, weekly, monthly practice patterns
- **Flexible roll-ups** â€“ View by practice area, project, task card, or individual todos
- **Visual insights** â€“ Charts and graphs that reveal practice habits
- **Progress tracking** â€“ See improvement trends and identify neglected areas
- **Goal setting** â€“ Set time targets and track achievement

### **Drag & Drop Task Management**

Reorder todos within cards, move cards between areas, reorganize on the fly. Because practice plans evolve, and your tool should adapt as quickly as your musical ideas do.

### **Enhanced Timer Intelligence**

- **Smart notifications** when focus sessions end
- **Automatic session logging** for detailed analytics
- **Cross-midnight session handling** for late-night practice warriors
- **Timer state persistence** across browser sessions

### **Performance & Polish**

- **Faster load times** and smoother animations
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for power users
- **Improved mobile experience** with better touch interactions
- **Export capabilities** for practice logs and session data

## The Bigger Picture

Every feature being built serves the core mission: **helping musicians practice more intentionally.**

Phase 1 proved we could organize practice sessions. Phase 2 will prove those sessions can be measurably more effective. By August 3, **FretTime** will be taking on the scope of a serious tool for practicing musicians.

**Ready for another 14-day sprint?** Follow along on X [@stcybrdgs] for updates, feature previews, and the inevitable 2 AM debugging sessions that make shipping software so satisfying. There may be some fails in there, too. We'll see.
