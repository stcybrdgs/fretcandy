# The FretTime Phase 1 Kickoff

_July 5, 2025_

## FretTime Officially Kicks Off

Well, that escalated quickly...

A month ago, I was convinced I was ready to dive straight into indie hacking with a custom fret charts app. Classic overconfidence from someone who's been out of the frontend game for too long. Reality check: my tech stack wasn't just stale â€“ it was vintage.

So here I am with a plot twist that's actually a blessing in disguise. Instead of fumbling through an MVP with outdated tools, I'm going back to basics. Building a 'Todo' app to learn React, Next.js, TypeScript, and modern deployment workflows (and some AI stuff, maybe?). But not just _any_ todo app.

It's FretTime!

> _FretTime is a productivity app that helps string players structure their practice sessions with task cards and built-in timers. Instead of scattered practice notes, you get a system designed around how musicians actually work â€“ chunking techniques and tunes into focused daily tasks while tracking your progress._

So, that's the vision. But, how do I get there?

## Where We're At

**The Brutal Truth:** I've been grinding for over a year to get back into tech after the 2023 layoffs. My existing skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Python, Flask, Vue.js) are solid, but the job market has moved on. React is everywhere. TypeScript is expected. Next.js and Vercel are standards. And then there's AI integration. So, it's not just FretTime, it's woodshed time, too.

**A Strategy Shift:** Instead of learning these tools in isolation or trying to fake my way through interviews, I'm building my way back. Every line of code documented, every struggle shared, every breakthrough celebrated in public.

**A Secret Weapon:** AI pair programming with Claude Sonnet 4. I've never built with an AI coding partner before, but early experiments suggest this could be a game-changer for leveling up quickly.

## Where We're Heading

FretTime isn't just a learning exercise â€“ it's the foundation for something bigger. The long-term vision includes:

- **Multi-platform deployment** (web, iOS, Android)
- **Advanced practice analytics** (time tracking, progress visualization)
- **Social features** (sharing practice plans, following other musicians)
- **Integration capabilities** (metronomes, backing tracks, sheet music)
- **Professional tools** (instructor accounts, student management)

But first, let's prove the core concept works.

## Phase 1 Focus: The Essential Features

Phase 1 will be all about nailing the fundamentals:

**Core Architecture:**

- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Zustand for state management
- Local storage for data persistence

**Essential User Experience:**

- **Practice Areas & Projects** â€“ Organize different aspects of your musical development
- **Task Cards** â€“ Break down complex techniques or songs into manageable chunks
- **Todo Management** â€“ Add, complete, and track individual practice tasks
- **Built-in Timer** â€“ Track time spent on each task with start/stop functionality
- **Mobile-First Design** â€“ Because musicians practice everywhere
- **Dark Mode** â€“ Because late-night practice sessions are real

**Technical Polish:**

- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Smooth animations and interactions
- Context menus for power users
- Keyboard shortcuts for efficiency
- Error handling and edge cases

## Timeline: From Zero to Go Live in 14 Days

Here's the initial, ambitious plan for Phase 1:

**Days 1-3: Foundation & Setup**

- Project initialization and tooling
- Basic component architecture
- Core data models and types
- Initial UI framework
- Vercel deployment setup

**Days 4-7: Core Features**

- Practice area and project management
- Task card creation and organization
- Todo CRUD operations
- Basic timer functionality

**Days 8-10: Enhanced UX**

- Context menus and bulk actions
- Timer integration with todo items
- Responsive design refinements
- Dark mode implementation

**Days 11-12: Polish & Testing**

- Animation and micro-interactions
- Edge case handling
- Performance optimization
- Cross-device testing

**Days 13-14: Deployment & Launch**

- Domain configuration
- Final testing and bug fixes
- Public launch announcement

## The Real Stakes

This isn't just about building an app â€“ it's about reminding myself that I can still plan, execute, and deliver. That I can learn modern tools quickly. That I can ship quality code under pressure. That I can turn a career setback into a comeback story.

Or, perhaps, it's more simple than all that. Perhaps it's simply about proving that I can still bring value to others through code, even if the career never comes back.
